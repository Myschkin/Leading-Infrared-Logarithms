This repository contains the notbooks to compute the LLog coefficients of different two dimensional sigma models
"Fundamental O(N+1)modO(N)" reproduces the results calculated by hands in section 5.1
"Adjoint SU(N)" computes the results given in section 5.2
"Adjoint SO(N)" computes the results given in section 5.3
